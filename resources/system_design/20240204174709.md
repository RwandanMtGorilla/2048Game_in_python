## Implementation approach

We will create a Python-based 2048 game that is both intuitive and engaging. To ensure accessibility across different devices, we will use a responsive design approach, possibly leveraging the 'pygame' library for desktop versions and 'kivy' for mobile responsiveness. For the UI, we will aim for a clean and minimalist design, using open-source libraries like 'pygame' for rendering the game interface. We will also implement features like undo moves and score tracking to enhance the user experience.

            L->>G: return new_board
        else Invalid Move
            G->>U: draw_board(board)  # Redraw unchanged board
        end
    end


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific open-source libraries to use for mobile responsiveness, as well as the extent of animations and effects desired in the UI.
