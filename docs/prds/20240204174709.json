The game should be visually appealing and user-friendly, with a responsive design for different devices. Additional features such as undo moves, score tracking, and difficulty levels could enhance the user experience.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Develop core game logic for tile movements and merging"],["P0","Implement score tracking and display current/high scores"],["P1","Create a responsive design for desktop and mobile platforms"],["P1","Design a user-friendly and visually appealing UI"],["P2","Add an undo move feature"]],"UI Design draft":"The UI will feature a clean and minimalist design with a grid layout for the game. It will include score display, high score tracking, and smooth animations for tile movements. The color scheme will be soothing to the eyes with distinct tile colors for different values.","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
